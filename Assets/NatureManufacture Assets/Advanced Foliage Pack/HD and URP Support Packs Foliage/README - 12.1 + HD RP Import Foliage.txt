BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 2021.3+ 
- you need HD RP pipline 12.1+
- there is wind prefab which will manage wind at your scene
Be patient this tech is so fluid... we coudn't follow ever beta version

Step 1 - Import our HD RP 12.1+ Unity 2021.3 Advanced Foliage Pack compatibility pack.
Step 2 - Setup Shadows and other render setups.

- !!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Open "Project settings" ->"Gaphics"-> "HDRP global settings" ->  "Diffusion Profile Assets" drag and drop our SSS settings diffusion profiles for foliage into Diffusion profile list:
NM_SSSSettings_Skin_Foliage
Without this foliage materials will not become affected by scattering.
